    Fish farming is undoubtedly one of the most popular type of farming in Nigeria at the moment. 
    Fish farming in Nigeria has gone beyond the traditional method of setting out into a river,
     stream, sea, ponds, or lakes to bait fish by either casting nets or fishing tackle 
     (although this is still very much practiced). Nowadays, with the modern-day fishing farming methods in Nigeria, 
    you can practice fish farming in your compound or with a water tank, provided you have the space.

    fishery products, 
    from fresh live catfish in plastic buckets to frozen fish, roasted fish, dry fish, and many more. There is a massive market for fish farmers in Nigeria, depending on the type of fish farming you wish to specialise in.
